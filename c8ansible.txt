20210509 - Created a linked-clone of c8 called c8ansible

SETUP
  The community ansible repo is already installed.
  (Do yum list all |grep ansible and you will find the repo bits... if you
   install those you will be able to pull from the community ansible repo
   however, be aware, epel has many of those and even newer)

  git is installed and git ssh keys are setup, and github is setup with this
  pubkey.

WHAT IS IT THAT I WISH TO DO:
  1) Hello world...build a playbook that sets the motd
  2) Find out if there are any libraries of cool ansible hardening bits for
     RHEL distros.

HELLO WORLD
  Get ansible to edit the contents of /etc/motd.  (empty file on fresh install)
  But first we are going to learn some syntax running as mgarlich (not root)

  cd ~/git/MGMgettingstarted
  mkdir ansible
  cd ansible
  mkdir playbooks
  cd playbooks
  vi HelloWorld.yml
  # REF: https://codingbee.net/ansible/ansible-a-hello-world-playbook
  cat HelloWorld.yml
---
- name: This is a hello-world example
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Create '/tmp/testfile.txt' with content 'hello world'.
      copy:
        content: hello world
        dest: /tmp/testfile.txt
# end of hello world
# now run it
  ansible-playbook ./HelloWorld.yml

#### push changes up into git
git status
git add ansible c8ansible.txt
git commit -m "adding ansible notes and tree"
git push

# A helpful command to list hosts: ansible all --list-hosts
# since I dont have any hosts setup, I just used "localhost" in the playbook

# now we want to push a file rather than build the content
cd /home/mgarlich/git/MGMgettingstarted/ansible
mkdir files
cd files
echo "Hello World - copyfile example" > testfile.txt
# now modify the playbook to use this copyfile source
cd ../playbooks
# edit HelloWorld.yml to look like this:
--
- name: This is a hello-world example
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Create '/tmp/testfile.txt' with content 'hello world'.
      copy:
        src: ./files/testfile.txt
        dest: /tmp/testfile.txt
##

# before I go further I want to use vim-ansible which I installed
vi ~/.vimrc
#add: au BufRead,BufNewFile */playbooks/*.yml set filetype=yaml.ansible

# also, the install docs mention this might be helpful:
yum install python3-argcomplete -y

#####
## Ok we want to use c8ansible to manage other hosts, they need to be
## able to talk to each other
## I am going to turn on the internal network in virtualbox under
## settings->Network->adapter2->turnon

## here is the net config of c8ansible BEFORE

# To change the IP address of the "virbr0" interface
nmcli connection modify virbr0 IPv4.address 192.168.122.10/24
# Notice that we specified the routing prefix together with the IP using
# the so called CIDR notation (Classes Inter-Domain Routing). We use a
# similar syntax to change the gateway and the dns settings:
nmcli connection modify virbr0 IPv4.gateway 192.168.122.1
nmcli connection modify virbr0 IPv4.dns 192.168.122.1
# Finally, we set the method to manual to avoid using any other
# boot protocol for the interface. This command sets the BOOTPROTO
# option to none in the interface configuration file:
nmcli connection modify virbr0 IPv4.method manual

# edit /etc/hosts and add these lines
192.168.122.10  c8ansible
192.168.122.11  c8client

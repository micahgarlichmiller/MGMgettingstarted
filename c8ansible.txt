20210509 - Created a linked-clone of c8 called c8ansible

SETUP
  The community ansible repo is already installed.
  (Do yum list all |grep ansible and you will find the repo bits... if you
   install those you will be able to pull from the community ansible repo
   however, be aware, epel has many of those and even newer)

  git is installed and git ssh keys are setup, and github is setup with this
  pubkey.

WHAT IS IT THAT I WISH TO DO:
  1) Hello world...build a playbook that sets the motd
  2) Find out if there are any libraries of cool ansible hardening bits for
     RHEL distros.

HELLO WORLD
  Get ansible to edit the contents of /etc/motd.  (empty file on fresh install)
  But first we are going to learn some syntax running as mgarlich (not root)

  cd ~/git/MGMgettingstarted
  mkdir ansible
  cd ansible
  mkdir playbooks
  cd playbooks
  vi HelloWorld.yml
  # REF: https://codingbee.net/ansible/ansible-a-hello-world-playbook
  cat HelloWorld.yml
---
- name: This is a hello-world example
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Create '/tmp/testfile.txt' with content 'hello world'.
      copy:
        content: hello world
        dest: /tmp/testfile.txt
# end of hello world
# now run it
  ansible-playbook ./HelloWorld.yml
